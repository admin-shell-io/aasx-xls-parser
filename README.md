When you convert AASX file to EXCEL file, you have to save your AASX file as JSON format by Aasx Package Explorer. Then you can ‘upload’ your AASX file (JSON format) to the web site. After a few seconds, the conversion is complete and you can download the EXCEL file. 

The process for converting EXCEL to AASX is the same. You can download the converted AASX file (JSON format) by uploading your EXCEL file.

Be sure to keep the AASX file together with the Excel file. Even if the format of the Excel file is changed, you can always convert it again if there is an AASX file.
